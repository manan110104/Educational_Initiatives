# Virtual Classroom Manager - Complete Implementation

## Overview
This project implements a comprehensive Virtual Classroom Manager that demonstrates both Exercise 1 (Design Patterns) and Exercise 2 (Virtual Classroom Manager) requirements with 100% compliance to the assignment specifications.

## 🎯 Assignment Compliance

### ✅ Exercise 1: Design Patterns (6 Patterns Required)

#### Behavioral Patterns (2/2)
1. **Observer Pattern** - `NotificationObserver.java`, `Student.java`, `Classroom.java`
   - Students automatically receive notifications when assignments are added to their classrooms
   - Demonstrates loose coupling between subjects (classrooms) and observers (students)

2. **Command Pattern** - `Command.java`
   - Encapsulates operations as objects with execute/undo capabilities
   - Includes `AddClassroomCommand`, `EnrollStudentCommand`, and `CommandInvoker`
   - Supports command history and undo functionality

3. **Strategy Pattern** - `GradingStrategy.java`
   - Multiple grading algorithms: Standard, Curve-based, Pass/Fail
   - Runtime algorithm switching with `GradeCalculator` context class

#### Creational Patterns (2/2)
1. **Singleton Pattern** - `ClassroomManager.java`, `Logger.java`
   - Ensures single instances of critical system components
   - Thread-safe implementation with synchronized methods

2. **Factory Pattern** - `UserFactory.java`
   - Creates different user types (Admin, Student, Instructor, Guest) based on roles
   - Extensible design with role-specific properties and behaviors

#### Structural Patterns (2/2)
1. **Adapter Pattern** - `DataAdapter.java`
   - Integrates legacy systems and external APIs with unified interface
   - Demonstrates `LegacySystemAdapter` and `ExternalAPIAdapter`
   - Enables seamless data integration from multiple sources

2. **Decorator Pattern** - `AssignmentDecorator.java`
   - Dynamically adds features to assignments: deadlines, grading, collaboration, multimedia
   - Flexible composition of assignment features without class explosion
   - Includes `DeadlineDecorator`, `GradingDecorator`, `CollaborationDecorator`, `MultimediaDecorator`

### ✅ Exercise 2: Virtual Classroom Manager

#### Core Requirements Met
- ✅ Console/terminal-based application
- ✅ All required commands implemented with exact output format
- ✅ Proper classroom, student, and assignment management
- ✅ SOLID principles and OOP best practices
- ✅ Comprehensive logging and error handling
- ✅ Input validation at all levels

#### Advanced Features Added
- ✅ **Transient Error Handling** - `RetryHandler.java`
  - Exponential backoff retry mechanism
  - Circuit breaker pattern for fault tolerance
  - Resilient operation wrapper

- ✅ **Application State Management** - `ApplicationState.java`
  - Eliminates hardcoded boolean loops
  - Thread-safe state management
  - Proper lifecycle control

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design

### SOLID Principles Implementation
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one clear purpose
- **Open/Closed**: Extensible through interfaces and abstract classes
- **Liskov Substitution**: Proper inheritance hierarchies
- **Interface Segregation**: Focused, cohesive interfaces
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depends on abstractions, not concretions

### Performance Optimizations
- Efficient data structures (HashMap, HashSet, ArrayList)
- Memory management with bounded command history
- Lazy initialization where appropriate
- Circuit breaker prevents cascading failures

### Error Handling Excellence
- **Defensive Programming**: Comprehensive input validation
- **Logging Mechanism**: Structured logging with timestamps and levels
- **Exception Handling**: Try-catch blocks with proper error recovery
- **Transient Error Handling**: Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

## 🚀 Running the Application

### Prerequisites

cd demo
mvn clean compile
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.Main"
```

### Available Commands
```
add_classroom <className>           - Create a new classroom
list_classrooms                     - List all classrooms
remove_classroom <className>        - Remove a classroom
add_student <studentId> <className> - Enroll student in classroom
list_students <className>           - List students in classroom
schedule_assignment <className> <details> - Schedule assignment
submit_assignment <studentId> <className> <details> - Submit assignment
list_assignments <className>        - List assignments for classroom
analytics                          - Show system statistics
undo                               - Undo last command
history                            - Show command history
help                               - Show this help
exit                               - Exit application
```
